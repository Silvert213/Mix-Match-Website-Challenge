        <h1> Owls & Surfing</h1>
        <!-- making seprate classes for each subject-->
        <p class="Owlz"> 
         Owls. Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight.
         Like hawks and eagles, owls are called raptors, or birds of prey, which means they use sharp talons and curved bills to hunt, kill, and eat other animals.
         My favorite owl is the Snowy Owl. The snowy owl, also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl, is a large, white owl of the true owl family. Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra.
         Snowy owls are active during the day, especially in the summer. They are diurnal, meaning they are most active during the day, unlike most other owls.

        <p class="Zurfing">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer, uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
            I have never surfed but I love to skateboard. Many people say Surfing and skateboarding are like long-lost siblings.
            Both sports are  about riding waves, but one involves water and the other involves pavement. They both require balance, skill, and a willingness to wipe out spectacularly.
            It is also said skateboarding can help you become a better surfer. You can practice tricks on your skateboard anytime, anywhere there is concrete. This allows for practice of your surf skills out of the water. 
            I would love to surf one day.
